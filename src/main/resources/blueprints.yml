# Blueprints are a simplified replacement for AspectAlchemy and a more engaging replacement for FactoryMod
# combined into one. Blueprints themselves are effectively crafting recipes which can be used some limited
# number of times. They are generated based on constraints defined in this document. Blueprints are meant
# to be used in workshops by an Estate (like factories from FactoryMod).
